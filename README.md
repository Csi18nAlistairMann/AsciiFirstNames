# AsciiFirstNames
A list of first names that use only ascii characters

The names are those from https://github.com/philipperemy/name-dataset subsequent to the Facebook hack referenced at https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/03/500-million-facebook-users-website-hackers. 

As I need the names for a CLI program, I've elected to remove all those names using characters other that A-Z and a-z, that is, that use Unicode; names using it may not always be printable. I've further cleaned the list of any names with a run of three or more characters, such as "Aaa"
